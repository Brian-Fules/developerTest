This is a project that new developers wishing to enter *the company* need to complete in order to advance the interview process.

First I will list you what will be given to you:

Either 1 of 2
1 - A backend that you need to call to get the data

2 - A couple of .json files that you need to get the data from(how you ask for the data will be taken into account)

The task is to make a webpage that lists all the people with all the data of the people, the people have a company code(because the backend was lazy), so, you have to load the companies too, and match each person with each company to show the company name in the table.

The second task, it's to be able to edit/add people of the list(in case of json files, it won't be asked to call a backend)

We will evaluate functionality and if it looks good.

It can be done by any framework/library you want to use, it needs to be done in under 2 hours.
